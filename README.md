Code Explanation:
1.Log Parsing
    The script uses regular expressions to extract relevant fields (IP address, HTTP method, endpoint, status code, etc.) from each log entry.
    These fields are stored in a Pandas DataFrame for efficient processing.
2.Data Analysis
    Requests per IP: Counts occurrences of each IP using value_counts().
    Most Accessed Endpoint: Uses value_counts() to determine the most frequently accessed endpoint.
    Suspicious Activity: Filters rows with failed login attempts (status 401 or specific messages) and counts occurrences per IP.
3.Output
    The results are written into log_analysis_results.csv in a structured format.
    The terminal displays the summarized results for each section.
